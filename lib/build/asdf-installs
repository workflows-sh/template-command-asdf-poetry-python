# Define dependencies in the style of a `.tool-versions` file used by the `asdf`
# version manager. The only difference between this file and a `.tool-versions`
# file is that the version doesn't need to be fully specified; simply the major
# version is enough, as the install script will automatically install the latest
# minor version available if none is specified.
